ShootingStar
-------------

Shooting star is a 2D platformer where the player controls a star that is trying to reach its home in the stars. It was a term project for my Intro to Game Programming course, and my team developed it using the Microsoft Direct3D 11.2 SDK in under 2 months without any prior game development knowledge.
 
How to run: Double-click on the ShootingStar/ShootingStar/ShootingStar.exe file
NOTE: In order to run Shooting Star, you must have the Microsoft Direct3D 11.2 SDK installed on the machine. If that doesn't work, ensure that the machine has any version of Visual Studio installed.
